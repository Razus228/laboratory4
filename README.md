# laboratory4
New lab, new tasks.
I continued my last work that used the inheritance principle and added a new principle, that is called polymorphism.
The main idea is that in the parent class we create a function with no return value, which is going to go via inheritance to the subclasses.
Not a very hard laboratory work, the main idea is very interesting and useful.
